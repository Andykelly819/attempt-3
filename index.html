  <h3><b>Customer Success Stories!</b></h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Hear from John Samuels: "I had struggled with chronic illness for years.
       My immune system would fall short every winter. Consistently contracting sicknesses 
    was keeping me from so many activities in life that I was missing.
    Eloheh provided the specific herbal remedy that allowed me to get back to the winter
    traditions that my grandchildren and I loved."</li>
     <br>
    <li>Maria Dukes had been a customer suffering from diabetes. She had tried

   Maria was able to get her life back and stabilize her blood sugar.
